Create a new type: vehicle. 
    1. The underlying type is a struct. 
    2. The fields: 
        - doors int
        - color string

Create two new types: truck & sedan. 
    1. The underlying type of each of these new types is a struct. 
    2. Embed the “vehicle” type in both truck & sedan. 
    3. Give truck the field “fourWheel” which will be set to bool. 
    4. Give sedan the field “luxury” which will be set to bool. 

Using the vehicle, truck, and sedan structs: 
    1. using a composite literal, create a value of type truck and assign values to the fields
    2. using a composite literal, create a value of type sedan and assign values to the fields. 
    
Print out each of these values. 
Print out a single field from each of these values.
