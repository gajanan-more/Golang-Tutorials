Use var to DECLARE three variables. The variables should have package level scope.
Use the following IDENTIFIRES for the variables and make sure the variables store the values of the following type.
    a. identifire "x" type int
    b. identifire "y" type string
    c. identifire "z" type bool

1. At the package level scope, assign the following values to the three variables
    a. for x, assign 42
    b. for y, assign "James Bond"
    c. for z, assign true

2. in func main,
    a. use fmt.Sprintf to print all the values to one single string. ASSIGN the returned value of TYPE string using the short declaration 
    operator to a VARIABLE with the IDENTIFIRE "s"
    b. print the value stored in variable "s"
