For this exercise,
1. Create your own type. Have the underlying type be an int.
2. Create a VARIABLE of your new TYPE with the IDENTIFIER "x" using the "VAR" keyword.
3. At the package level scope, using the "var" keyword, create a VARIABLE with the IDENTIFIER "y".
The variable should be UNDERLYING TYPE of your custom TYPE "x".
4. In func main,
    a. print out the value of the variable "x"
    b. print out the type of the variable "x"
    c. assign 42 to the VARIABLE "x" using the "=" operator
    d. print out the value of the variable "x" 
    e. Now use CONVERSION to convert the TYPE of the VALUE stored in "x" to the UNDERLYING TYPE then 
    ASSIGN that value to "y".
    f. Print out the value stored in "y" and the type of "y"
