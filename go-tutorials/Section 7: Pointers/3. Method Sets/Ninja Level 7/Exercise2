Create a person struct
Create a func called "chagneMe" with a *person as a parameter
    - change the value stored at *person address
    - Important:
        - to dereference a struct, use (*value).field
        - As an exception, if the type of x is a named-pointer type and (*x).f
          is a valid selector expression denoting a field (but not a method),
          x.f is shortland for (*x).f
Create a value of type person
    - print out the value
In func main
    - call chagneMe
In func main
    - print out the value
