Golang Tutorials
=========================

## Introduction

Go is also known as Golang. It is an open source, compiled programming language developed Google. 

Go is a general purpose programming language which can be used for the creation of highly available and scalable web apps. It can also be used to create the command line applications, desktop apps and even also mobile applications.

It has a simple syntax and also have a good back up of robust standard library. 


### Advantage of Go

There are several reasons why you should use Golang over other programming languages like python, nodejs, ruby, etc

Following are the advantages of Golang:

#### 1. Simple Syntax
Golang has a really simple syntax which is very useful to understand and learn Golang. This also makes it easy to write code which will be readble and easy to maintain.

#### 2. Go Tools
There are some powerful tools comes with Golang that are very helpful for developers to write the code. Tools which are commonly used by devs are:

##### i. gofmt: It automatically formats the source code.

##### ii. golint: It is used to find out some styling issues in the code.

##### iii. vet: It analyses the code and reports if there are any suspicious code. 

##### iv. gobuild: It helps you to build the executable files on your platform. 

#### 3. Fast Compilation
The Golang compiler is designed to be very fast.

#### 4. Concurrent Applications
We can use Goroutines and channels to write the multithreaded applications

#### 5. Open Source
This is main adavantage of Go as this is an open source project and anyone can contribute to this project.


### Installation

Golang can be installed on any platforms like MacOS, Windows and Linux. You just need to download the binary for your respective platform from [https://golang.org/dl](https://golang.org/dl).
