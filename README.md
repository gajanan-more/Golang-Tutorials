Golang Tutorials
===================

This repo has the collection of examples of various Golang concepts and topics with some exercises with their solutions. The concepts are divided among different `sections` under go-tutorials directory.

Sections has different directories as per topics with a `README.md` which explains the topic and a `main.go` which has a relevant example. Each section has some exercise files to check your knowledge with solutions provided to cross-check your answers.

The programs and the exercises are pretty much basic and easy to understand.

To install the Golang on your system, please do visit [my blog post](https://gajananmore.wordpress.com/2020/09/24/the-go-programming-language-introduction-and-installation/)

Hope you will love it.
